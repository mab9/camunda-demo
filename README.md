Camunda toolkit serves as my personal open source process engine toolkit. It may help other developer as well with a lot
of examples, descriptions and insights.

The toolkit provides some demo processes, camunda api examples, my personal best practices, notes and how tos. Yes, even
a playground where you can try out all kinds of different camunda things. I love playgrounds. It aims to make it easier
to develop.

## Installing camunda toolkit

To install the toolkit, follow these steps:

Linux, Windows, i0S with java 11:

    1. git clone https://github.com/mab9/camunda-toolkit.git 
    2. mvn clean package -DskipTests

To be able to use the full potential of this toolkit, you will have to install the camunda modeler as well! The modeler
will provide you a GUI to check out the demo processes and even develop your own BPMNs.
Follow [these](https://docs.camunda.org/get-started/quick-start/install/#camunda-modeler) descriptions to install the
modeler.

## Some examples and how tos

### The demo process

Yey, this project method is tough. The demo process is an agile development process that is modeled with BPMN. The process uses several
frequently applied features of camunda.

![bpmn of development process](./img/development-process.png "bpmn of development process")

This BPMN shows the development process that uses the following features:

- external task for heavy work like process big files
- user task for user interactions
- service tasks for short computer work like doing a request
- gateways
- listeners, delegators, expressions and more
- Looper kind of for each execution
- test framework

The development process demonstrates the use of those features and can be used as a playground. Do some funny stuff, test
how features work, do analyses and so on. Feel free.

### Run demo process

Follow these steps to run the engine with the demo development processes:

    1. mvn spring-boot:run
    2. invoke http://localhost:8080
    3. Login with credential defined in the application.yaml (id, password)
    4. Open the task list: http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/tasklist and check the user task "commitment"
    
    5. Navigate to deployed processes: http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/cockpit/default/#/processes
    6. Open the "Development process"

**The development process will be auto deployed on the started process engine** 

### Have fun with playground

Use the playground to get warm with camunda, to test stuff and create POCs or just for fun. 
To use the full potential of the playground, you will have to install camunda modeler. The modeler will allow you to
edit BPMNs and develop your processes. 

Always create a branch to have fun and try and error your new features. As soon your branch is ready, start the process engine and modeler to play around. 
This is the way you will enjoy to work with the playground.

    1. git checkout -b camunda-first-steps
    2. mvn spring-boot:run
    3. Start camunda modeler
    4. Enjoy the work

Feel free to touch and edit each part of the code. You are on the playground.

- [camunda user guide - feature documentation](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.14/user-guide/process-engine/)

**Run the demo process, have a look at the cockpit, deploy process by hand, checkout the other code and how stuff was implemented**


### My gathered best practices

- use accessor pattern to handle variables (distributed system)
 - if not needed, do not hold complex objects within the scope
 - add link to camunda doc.
- external task to handle long runnings -> config external tasks with listeners or input vars
- use only one method to configure your tasks. it's not a good idea to have defined some config varia bles within a
 listener others into a delegator and more via input method.
- best approach to implement / develop processes
 - do not misuse delegators. delegators are no services that handle heavy work!
 - test your process!
 - don't make your work dependent on a working process!
 - implement your process in one piece. No incremental development! This does not mean, that you should not edit or
 extend your process.
 - handle flow variable and separate them from others.
 - ...?
